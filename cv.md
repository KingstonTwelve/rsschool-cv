## About me
*I met with IT on programming courses at the IT Class training center (Gomel) in September 2018. I learned the basics of front-end (HTML / CSS) there. Also, I studied programming algorithms (C / C ++), the basics of SQL, and building relational databases.*
*I started my career in a small web studio MediaLime (https://medialime.by/). I learned to create sites using cms WordPress (LandigPage, corporate sites and stores). I raised the level of HTML / CSS / JS during the work.*
*I learn JS in my free time. I get skills at online workshops and at educational resources. In general, I am engaged in self-education. I have a great desire to grow in front-end development.*
*I also attend English courses twice a week.*
*About me: responsible, assiduous and easily trained. I am calm and positive about any problems, I think this is my forte.*
